# Go Stack Bootcamp

Rocketseat's GoStack Bootcamp is geared towards programmers with an existing experience on the Full Stack scenario. Knowledge on HTML/CSS/JS/SQL is mandatory to excel on it and complete it in time.

The Bootcamp has a duration of 20 weeks and it's going to cover concepts on fundamental areas of the current most popular Stack, including, but not exclusively:

* NodeJS
* React JS
* React Native
* TypeScript
* TDD
* JEST testing
* SQL database/syntax
* Advanced CSS
* SOLID Software Architecture

## What will you find here?

Every single challenge and code written during my journey. You can navigate through the modules covered below, or explore the repository on your own. Most projects will have dependencies needed to be installed to function properly, at which there will be an instruction on each directory on how to do it.

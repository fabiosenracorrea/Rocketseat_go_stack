# Go Stack Bootcamp

[Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)'s GoStack Bootcamp is geared towards programmers with an existing experience on the Full Stack scenario. Knowledge on HTML/CSS/JS/SQL is mandatory to excel on it and complete it in time. The course is one of the best (if not THE best) courses Brazil has to offer on the Web-Dev track and it's highly acknowledged on the field and rated almost perfectly.

The course has a max-duration of 20 weeks and it covers knowledge on the most desired technologies on the web-track. As such, the content seen here can be divided into:

## Backend content

* Basic & Advanced concepts on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Routing with [ExpressJs](https://expressjs.com/)
* REST API
* HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
* Middleware usage (e.g. auth, validation)
* Query, Route & Body params
* Advanced Debugging w/ attaching
* SQL/no-SQL interaction with [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/)
* Regular user-data management with [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) (creating and updating relations)
* SQL migrations
* How and Why to cache data with [Redis](https://redis.io/)
* high-volume low-level relational data management with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* Authentication with [JWT](https://jwt.io/)
* Setting up and maintaining [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers
* File uploading and management
* Error handling globally
* Project divided into modules, infra layers and [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles
* Route controllers
* Dependency injection with [tsyringe](https://github.com/microsoft/tsyringe)
* Repositories as the only access to databases
* E-mail provider as [Ethereal](https://ethereal.email/) and [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/ses/)
* Password cryptography and best practices
* .env file - protecting sensitive project data
* Storage provider as **local disk space** and [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/s3/)

## Frontend & Mobile: ReactJS & React Native

* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) & [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/) knowledge and standard configuration
* Advanced styling with CSS - global & 'local' styling
* Component styling with [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
* Functional components and the power of [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), mainly useState, useMemo, useCallback, useEffect, useRef, useContext.
* [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) development and understanding
* Local Storage usage & best practices with sensitive data
* Routing with [React-Router-Dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
* CUSTOM routes creation (auth-routes x normal routes)
* API connection with [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
* Component re-utilization and with low complexity
* Error handling: app erros & user-produced errors
* Form validation with [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
* Authentication (keeping an user logged in)
* Toast messages of success/info/error

* Basic differences React x React Native - custom components, inheritance, text content limitation (`<Text>`), semantics.
* Smartphone/OS differences and how to deal with them.
* Phone emulation to best test the application on different devices


## Tools & Best practices

* [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) to enforce code style
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to strictly control typing across every file
* [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing with TDD and unitary tests
* [React-Testing-Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

## Deployment

* TBA

## Final Project

During the course, a fully functional application was built from scratch. You can find it's code and previews on a separate repository here. **(TBA TBA TBA)**

## What will you find here?

Every single challenge and code written during my journey. You can navigate through the modules covered below, or explore the repository on your own. Most projects will have dependencies needed to be installed to function properly, at which there will be an instruction on each directory on how to do it.

### Challenge List

1. [Basic NodeJS](Module_01_NodeJS)
2. [Basic ReactJS](Module_02_ReactJS)
3. [Basic React Native](Module_03_React_Native)
4. [Advanced Software Architecture with NodeJS](Module_04_Advanced_Software_Architecture_with_NodeJS)
5. [Databases](Module_5_Database_NodeJS)
6. [Real Interfaces with React](Module_06_RealInterfaces_w_React)
7. [Advanced React Native Interfaces](Module_07_Advanced_React_Native_Interfaces)
8. [Advanced Database Relations w/ TypeORM](Module_08_Database_Relations_w_NodeJS_Typeorm)
9. [Advanced CRUD with React](Module_09_Advanced_CRUD_w_React)
10. [Advanced CRUD with React Native](Module_10_Advanced_CRUD_w_React_Native)

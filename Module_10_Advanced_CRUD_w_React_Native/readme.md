To see the full instructions of the challenge, you can click [here](./project-instructions.md).

After understanding React as a whole and digging deep on React Native, it's time to put everything to a more complex CRUD application testing. This time, obviously, on mobile!

This application ultimately is an app for a restaurant to display it's menu and register orders.

#### How to run this module's challenge

*preparing*

1. clone this repository.
2. On the cloned directory, run either `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `yarn test` or `npm test` to see each test result

- If you'd like to check the interface out:
